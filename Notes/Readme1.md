                                    Ch-1 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

A computer is an electronic device which accepts data as input, processes that data and provides the expected output.
Need for using Computer:
    1. Speed: A computer processes data at a much greater speed.
    2. Memory: A computer can store lots and lots of data in its memory and it can also recall those data immediately.
    3. Multi tasking: A computer can peroform thousands and thousands of parallel tasks simmultaneously.
    4. Reliability: Computers are reliable in the sense that they will not fail due to any reason.

Software: A software may be defined as a collection of inter related programs.
Programs: A program may be defined as a collection of instructions.
Instructions: Instructions are the commands which we give to the computer to acheive a particular task using a specific language.
Computer Language: A computer language is the language using which we can provide instructions to the compiler.
    A computer language can be classified mainly into two types:
        i. Machine Level or Low Level:- Eg.-Binary(Only language which computer understands)
        ii. High Level Language:- Also called as english like language. Eg.-C,C++,JAVA,Python
    
                                                Object Oriented Programming

Q)What is Object Oriented Programming?
    Programs which deals with concept of object is called an Object Oriented Programmming.
    
Object:
    An object may be defined as a representation of a real world entity with unique identity, embedded properties and the ability to interact with other objects.
    An object contains both Data members (Variables) & Member Functions (Functions).

Q)What do you mean by Object Oriented Programming Language?
    A programming language is called Object Oriented Programming Language if and only if it has the following features:
        i.Encapsulation -
                Encapsulation is the mechanism by which variables(data) and the functions(methods), which access those data are grouped together as a single unit.
                In an object oriented programming language, encapsulation is acheived using a concept called Class.
        ii. Data abstraction and data hinding-
                Data abstraction meand hiding the working complexity of the data and the function from the outside code/world.
                Encapsulation is the mechanism and its outcome is data abstraction.
        iii. Polymorphism-
                The term poly means many and morph means form. It is a mechanism by which same interface can be used in order to acheive multiple tasks. In an OOP polymorphism is acheived using concepts like function overloading, function overriding, constructor overloading,etc.
        iv. Inheritance-
                Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class accquires the features of another class. Through inheritance an object oriented program, supports the concept of code reusability.

Types of Object Oriented Programming:
    An OOP can be classified into mainly three types.
        i. Partial Object Oriented:
                A partial OOP has the support for all the four features of OOPS, but supports any one,two,or three features partially.
                    Eg.- C++
                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                    NOTE: In C++, the encapsulation feature is partially supported, because the main() in C++is written outside the class.
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        ii. Fully Object Oriented Programming:
                A programming language is called to be Fully OOP language if and only if it supports all the four features of OOPs fully.
                    Eg.- JAVA
        
        iii. Complete Object Oriented Programming:
                A programming language is called to be Complete Object Oriented Programming language if it is a Fully OOP language and it has no support for any primitive datatype.
                As JAVA supports primitive data types, hence it is not a Complete OOP Language.
                Eg.- SmallTalk
